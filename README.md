# Covid-SNA
Project involves: 

1- Mathematical modeling of the spread of a pandemic in a population considering the case of SEIR Model (Suspectible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) over a contact network. 

2- Creating of the Monte Carlo simulation of the mathematical model for numerical analysis. 

3- Creating a web demo of the spread of pandemic in a network using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Project Members:
