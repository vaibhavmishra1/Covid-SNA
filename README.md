# Covid-SNA

Project involves: 

* Mathematical modeling of the spread of a pandemic in a population considering the case of SEIR Model (Suspectible-Exposed-Infected-Recovered) over a contact network. 

* Creating of the Monte Carlo simulation of the mathematical model for numerical analysis. 

* Creating a web demo of the spread of pandemic in a network using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 

Project Members:
Vaibhav Mishra | Muzzafer Ali | Abhinav Pandey | Kunal Jangid

Project Duration : 1 October,2020 - 1 Nov,2020.

Checklist:

1- **Mathematical Model - Completed**

2- **Monte Carlo Simulation-  Completed**

3- **Web Demonstration - Completed**


**Project Instructions:**
* To understand the mathematics, refer to the mathematical-model.pdf.
* The simulation is done on two graphs, first graph is a random contact network graph based on SEIR Model, the simulation for which can be found at plots_random.ipynb. 
* The simulation for the second graph can be found at plots-gaussian.ipynb where a gaussian graph is used to create a contact network and plots are plotted.
* the simulation is done using monte carlo and the code is written in python.
* A web interface is designed for visualizing the progress of spread of pandemic in a contact network written in CSS, HTML anf JavaScript present in simulation folder.
